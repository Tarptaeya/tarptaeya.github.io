    <h1>Hi there, I am Anmol.</h1>
    <p>
    Welcome to my homepage. I am a software engineer at <b>Meta</b>
    (formerly Facebook), based in Mountain View.
    </p>
    <p>
    Outside of work, I spend most of my time writing compilers, game and graphics engines, and
    AI agents. Most of my work is not open-source, but you can find some of my projects on my
    <a href="https://github.com/tarptaeya" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    I did my bachelors in Computer Science from IIT Gandhinagar (2016-2020). In 2018,
    I was selected in <b>Google Summer of Code</b> under <b>KDE</b> to implement JavaScript/QML
    extension support for Falkon. During my bachelors, I won several intra-college
    programming contests and also qualified for ACM-ICPC regionals.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ironically, I am not that active on social media, but I sometimes write about programming
    on my <a href="https://anmolgautam.com/blog" target="_blank">blog</a>.
