I am accepted as a GSoC student this year to hack on <a href=\"http://falkon.org\">Falkon</a>. Currently Falkon supports extensions but in C++ and Python. My project is to implement JavaScript/QML extension support for Falkon so that its both easy to develop and distribute.</p>\n\n<p>I greatly thank my mentor <a href=\"http://github.com/nowrep\">David Rosca</a> for helping me in the bug fixes and also reviewing my application, besides all the KDE members :)</p>\n\n<p>Current phase is community bonding period and Coding Phase will start from 14th May.
