I am writing this blog to share my experience and work done in the coding phase. I want to specially thank my mentor David Rosca for his help, suggestions and reviews. This was my first exposure to the KDE community and I am proud that it was great. I really enjoyed the whole program from proposal submission - intermediate evals - then now this final evaluation. Also, I had learned a lot working on my project. Frankly speaking, I didn't knew about i18n and l10n much but with the help of my mentor now I have a quite good understanding of how these works and are implemented. I can truly say this was one of my best summer vacations.</p>\n\n<p>The code will soon be merged with the master branch of falkon. You can see my <a href=\"https://community.kde.org/GSoC/2018/StatusReports/AnmolGautam\">status report</a> page for more details about the work done during GSoC. Also in the last weeks I have implemented an extensions page for falkon similar to <em>about:addons</em> in firefox. Below is the screenshot of <em>falkon:extensions</em> page. This also enables to remove the extension from local storage. Also, the themes can be viewed and controlled by the theme panel on the same page.\n<center>\n<style>\nimg {\nwidth: 80%;\nheight: auto;\n}\n</style>\n<img src=\"falkon_extensions_extensions.png\" alt=\"Falkon<em>Extensions</em>Page\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"falkon_extensions_themes.png\" alt=\"Falkon<em>Themes</em>Page\" />\n</center>\nAnd yes, I will regularly contribute to KDE community specially Falkon.</p>\n\n<p>Happy August</p>\n"}
