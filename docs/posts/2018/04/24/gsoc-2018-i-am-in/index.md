Wooo... I am accepted as a GSoC student this year to hack on [Falkon](http://falkon.org). Currently Falkon supports extensions but in C++ and Python. My project is to implement JavaScript/QML extension support for Falkon so that its both easy to develop and distribute.

I greatly thank my mentor [David Rosca](http://github.com/nowrep) for helping me in the bug fixes and also reviewing my application, besides all the KDE members :\) 

Current phase is community bonding period and Coding Phase will start from 14th May. I will keep this blog updated about the latest updates on my project and KDE.

You can find my GSoC proposal [here](draft.pdf).

Happy Summers :)
