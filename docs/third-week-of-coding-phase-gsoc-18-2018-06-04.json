The follwoing APIs are developed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Clipboard API: The API to interact with Clipboard.</li>\n<li>Notifications API: The API to display desktop notifications.</li>\n<li>Tabs API: The API to interact with Tabs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Clipboard API</h3>\n\n<p>This is a very short API - just with one method copy, enabling copying to clipboard by passing a JavaScript object containg text to Falkon.Clipboard.copy.</p>\n\n<h3>Notifications API</h3>\n\n<p>This is also a very short API - just with one method create, enabling creation of desktop notifications by passing a JavaScript object containg icon(url), heading and message of the notification to Falkon.Notifications.create.</p>\n\n<h3>Tabs API</h3>\n\n<p>API consumed a humongous time of both me and my mentor David. This exposes the Falkon c++ methods of TabWidget class as singleton Falkon.Tabs and methods of WebTab class as uncreatable type Falkon.Tab.\n<center>\n<img src=\"meme_week_3.jpg\" alt=\"No compatibility table this time\" />\n</center></p>\n\n<p>This time I am not including the WebExtension compatibility table as the APIs developed are not similar to the WebExtension APIs.\nAlso, I am very thankful to my mentor David Rosca for always helping me.</p>\n\n<p>Happy Summers!</p>\n"}
