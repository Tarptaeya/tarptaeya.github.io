{"title": "Eighth & Ninth week of coding phase, GSoC'18", "published_at": "2018-07-15", "content": "I am very happy that the third phase of coding phase has begun. The following work is done in eighth & ninth week:\n\n- UserScript API\n- Ability to register external QtObject\n- ExtensionScheme API\n\n## UserScript API\nThe API to interact with browser user-scripts. This will enable the plugin to create, register, remove, and get all the user-scripts loaded in the browser. Also the scripts registered by it will automatically gets unregistered when the plugin unloads.\n\n## Ability to register external QtObject\nSince the UserScript API is developed, so the next step was to develop a channel between qml-plugin and webengine. The ExternalJsObject type will enable a QtObject to register as external js object as Falkon.ExternalJsObject.registerExtraObject ({id, object}) and Falkon.ExternalJsObject.unregisterExtraObject({object}) to unregister the object.\n\n## ExtensionScheme API\nNow as both UserScript and ExternalJsObject APIs are developed, the next step as suggested by my mentor was to implement an **extension://** page for qml-plugins.\n\nThis time, unfortunately I am yet to add the documentation & tests of the following APIs, but I will complete it soon.\n\nHappy Monsoon :-)"}
