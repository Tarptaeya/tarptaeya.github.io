Currently Falkon supports extensions but in C++ and Python. My project is to implement JavaScript/QML extension support for Falkon so that its both easy to develop and distribute.\n\nI greatly thank my mentor [David Rosca](http://github.com/nowrep) for helping me in the bug fixes and also reviewing my application, besides all the KDE members :\\) \n\nCurrent phase is community bonding period and Coding Phase will start from 14th May. I will keep this blog updated about the latest updates on my project and KDE.\n\nYou can find my GSoC proposal [here](draft.pdf).\n\nHappy Summers :)\n"}
