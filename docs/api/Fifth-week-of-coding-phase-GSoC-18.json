The follwoing APIs are developed:\n\n- BrowserAction API: to add a GUI popup button to navigation tool bar and status bar\n- SideBar API: to add a side bar widget to the browser\n\nBelow are the screeshots of the [Hello QML plugin](https://cgit.kde.org/falkon.git/tree/src/scripts/helloqml?h=anmolgautam) from my working [branch](https://cgit.kde.org/falkon.git/log/?h=anmolgautam)\n## BrowserAction Button\nBrowser Action Button can be added to either Navigation Tool Bar or Status Bar or both.\n\n![Browser_Action_Button](browser_action_button.png)\n\n## BrowserAction Popup\nThe popup for Browser Action Button is in form of [QML Window](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-window-window.html). This part took much time to develop because:\n\n- To show the GUI, QQuickWidget (QWidget) or QQucikWindow (QWindow) can be used.\n- Now popup property is a QQmlComponent thus the source Url is not known. Also QQuickWidget uses url - thus only solution left is to use QQuickWindow (by casting object created using QQmlComponent::create)\n- Now to show popup the Qt::Popup flag is needed for QQuickWindow.\n\nEverything is fine upto this until I found that this didn't worked. My Mentor (David Rosca) explained that this is because the QWindow is not grabing mouse and keyboard events - which means that the window is not activated - so I added QWindow::requestActivate and It works like a charm!\n\n![Browser_Action_Popup](browser_action_popup.png)\n\n## SideBar Menu\n\n![SideBar_Menu](sidebar_menu.png)\n\n## SideBar\nAgain SideBar menu is a QQuickWindow which is embeded into the browser using QWidget::createWindowContainer.\n\n![SideBar](sidebar.png)\n\n<hr/>\nAgain, a great thanks to my mentor David Rosca to help me in developing the APIs for GUI.\n\nHappy Fathers Day!\n"}
