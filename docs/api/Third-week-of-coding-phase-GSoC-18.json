{"title": "Third week of coding phase, GSoC'18", "published_at": "2018-06-04", "content": "The week was totally involved in developing QML APIs which are **not** similar to WebExtension APIs. The follwoing APIs are developed:\n\n- Clipboard API: The API to interact with Clipboard.\n- Notifications API: The API to display desktop notifications.\n- Tabs API: The API to interact with Tabs.\n\n### Clipboard API\nThis is a very short API - just with one method copy, enabling copying to clipboard by passing a JavaScript object containg text to Falkon.Clipboard.copy.\n\n### Notifications API\nThis is also a very short API - just with one method create, enabling creation of desktop notifications by passing a JavaScript object containg icon(url), heading and message of the notification to Falkon.Notifications.create.\n\n### Tabs API\nAPI consumed a humongous time of both me and my mentor David. This exposes the Falkon c++ methods of TabWidget class as singleton Falkon.Tabs and methods of WebTab class as uncreatable type Falkon.Tab. \n<center>\n<style>\nimg {\nwidth: 80%;\nheight: auto;\n}\n</style>\n\n![No compatibility table this time](meme_week_3.jpg)\n\n</center>\n\nThis time I am not including the WebExtension compatibility table as the APIs developed are not similar to the WebExtension APIs.\nAlso, I am very thankful to my mentor David Rosca for always helping me.\n\nHappy Summers!\n"}
